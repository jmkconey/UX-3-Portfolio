    "string": "Hi, iʻm Jessie! I was born and raised in Volcano Hawaii and once graduated from high school in 2015 I moved to Cheney Washington to attend Eastern Washington University (EWU). I plan to graduate from EWU in Spring 2019 with a BA in Visual Communication Design along with a User Experience (UX) Design certificate as well as an art minor. \n\nI have worked for AS Deigns and services in Hilo, HI as their graphic design intern intermittently for a few years. Working with AS Designs & Services I was able to help photograph various company products ranging from clothes to beer from Mehana Brewing Co. as well as assist in social media marketing and word press alterations. I am currently the social media manager for Kilauea Lodge. I manage the content for Facebook, Instagram as well as Twitter and keep track of the statistics each week to make sure that their social media precence continuously grows.  In coordinance to that, I work in the Marketing and Communications (MarCom) Department at EWU as their Assistant Graphic Designer. At MarCom I create a variety of content for a variety of clients all with a variety of platforms. I am also currently interning at Travis Pattern and Foundry as their graphic designer with the sole purpose of re-designing their catalog. \n\nAlthough I have gained a new outlook on many things and have gained to appreciate what the Pacific Northwest has to off I am ready to slowly make my way back home. Following EWU I plan to move back to Oahu, HI and pursue a job in the UX or graphic design industry. \n\nAside from all this, I love to travel and aspire to one day travel the world. I have been to 37 of the 50 states and have traveled to Canada, Japan, and China which is nothing in comparison to how much of the world there is still to travel. It fascinates me to see different cultures and more specifically different styles of design within each culture. "
